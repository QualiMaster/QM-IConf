# QM-IConf
The QualiMaster (http://qualimaster.eu) infrastructure configuration tool (QM-IConf) allows configuring the QualiMaster infrastructure (https://github.com/QualiMaster/Infrastructure) as 
well as the data analysis pipelines running on a certain infrastructure. In particular, it allows configuring data analysis pipelines in a graphical drag-and-drop fashion and enables
the user to generate the respective pipeline code from the configuration. QM-IConf is a domain-specific graphical frontend for the Open Source product 
line toolset EASy-Producer (https://github.com/SSEHUB/EASyProducer).

For developing QM-IConf, the following parts must be installed:
  - EASy-Producer (https://github.com/SSEHUB/EASyProducer) as source code or as release bundles.
  - EASy-Producer extensions for the QualiMaster (https://github.com/QualiMaster/QM-EASyProducer)
  - Eugenia diagram editor generation framework
  - Emfatic EMF editor
  - Graphical Modeling Framework
  - Graphical Modeling Framework tools (experimental SDK)
  
For more (technical) details, please refer to the readme file.

QM-IConf is released as open source under the Apache 2.0 license.
